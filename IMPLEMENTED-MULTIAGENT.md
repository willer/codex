# Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the two-stage "Architect / Coder" pipeline for Codex-CLI as specified in the PLAN-multiagent.md file.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **Schemas and Types**: 
   - Created `change_plan.ts` with Zod schemas for validating the Change Plan JSON structure
   - Defined types for actions (edit, command, message)

2. **Prompts**:
   - Added prompts directory with architect.md and coder.md
   - Implemented role-specific system prompts that enforce strict output formats

3. **Model Wrappers**:
   - Created models.ts to encapsulate API calls to Architect and Coder models
   - Implemented retry logic for rate limits and network errors
   - Added telemetry tracking

4. **Context Management**:
   - Implemented context.ts for generating file summaries and build context for Coder
   - Added caching for file summaries

5. **Orchestrator**:
   - Created orchestrator.ts with a state machine to control the flow
   - Implemented action processing for each action type
   - Added health checks to verify operations

6. **Configuration**:
   - Updated config.ts with multi-agent specific settings
   - Added defaults for Architect and Coder models
   - Extended configuration types for new parameters

7. **CLI Integration**:
   - Added --multi-agent flag to CLI
   - Updated runQuietMode to conditionally use the Orchestrator

8. **Tests**:
   - Added unit tests for Change Plan validation
   - Created mock tests for the Orchestrator
   - Added a test fixture project for integration testing

## Usage

The multi-agent mode can be activated with the `--multi-agent` flag:

```bash
codex --multi-agent "Implement a function to calculate the factorial of a number"
```

Configuration can be customized in the ~/.codex/config.json file:

```json
{
  "multiAgent": true,
  "architectModel": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "coderModel": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125",
  "coderTemp": 0.2
}
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Failure Recovery**: Enhance retry and recovery logic when actions fail
2. **Parallel Processing**: Add support for parallel execution of compatible actions
3. **Telemetry Dashboards**: Visualize cost savings and token usage metrics
4. **Command Whitelisting**: Implement security controls for command execution
5. **Further Testing**: Add more comprehensive integration tests
